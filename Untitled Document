In Rule 08, you're told to use a participle to pre-modify the verb. Now, there are two types of participles you might see:

✅ 1. Present participle: ends in -ing
It usually shows an action happening at the same time as the main verb.

Example:

Looking around, she saw some pebbles.
➤ "Looking" and "saw" are happening together.

✅ 2. Past participle: often ends in -ed, but irregular forms exist too
It usually shows a completed action, or a condition caused by something.

Example:

Terrified by fear, the boy couldn’t speak.
➤ The boy was already terrified before or at the moment of not being able to speak.
