 Of course. Yes, there is a much simpler way that doesn't involve the fs module or manually constructing file paths.

  You can directly import your JSON files into your Next.js page. Next.js is configured to handle JSON imports out of the box, treating them as JavaScript objects.

  Hereâ€™s how you would do it:

   1. Place your JSON files in the data directory (e.g., /data/rules.json, /data/questions.json).

   2. Import them directly in your page file (e.g., pages/index.js):

    1     // pages/index.js
    2     import rules from '../data/rules.json';
    3     import questions from '../data/questions.json'; // Assuming this is your combined file
    4 
    5     export async function getStaticProps() {
    6       // The data is already loaded and parsed by the import statements above.
    7       // You can now pass it directly to your component's props.
    8 
    9       // You can also perform any necessary transformations here, just like the original project did.
   10       const allQuestions = questions.map(q => ({
   11         ...q,
   12         year: parseInt(q.id.split('-')[1]), // Example: "dhaka-2023-a" -> 2023
   13         board: q.id.split('-')[0].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + q.id.split('-')[0].slice(1) // -> "Dhaka"
   14       }));
   15 
   16       const uniqueBoards = [...new Set(allQuestions.map(q => q.board))];
   17 
   18       return {
   19         props: {
   20           rules,
   21           questions: allQuestions,
   22           boards: uniqueBoards,
   23         },
   24       };
   25     }
   26 
   27     // Your page component
   28     function YourPage({ rules, questions, boards }) {
   29       // You can now use the rules, questions, and boards props to build your UI.
   30       // This is where you would place the logic from the App.tsx file.
   31       // For example:
   32       return (
   33         <div>
   34           <h1>Grammar Rules</h1>
   35           <ul>
   36             {rules.map(rule => (
   37               <li key={rule.id}>{rule.title}</li>
   38             ))}
   39           </ul>
   40           {/* ... and so on for questions */}
   41         </div>
   42       );
   43     }
   44 
   45     export default YourPage;

  Why This Works Better

   * Simplicity: It's the cleanest and most direct way to include static data in your application. You don't need Node.js-specific modules like fs or path.
   * Build-Time Optimization: When you import the JSON, Next.js includes the data in your application's JavaScript bundle at build time. When getStaticProps runs, the data is instantly available without needing to
     read from the file system.
   * Type Safety: If you are using TypeScript, this approach provides better type inference for your data.

  This is the recommended approach for handling local, static data files in a Next.js project.
