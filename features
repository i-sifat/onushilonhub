FEATURE 1: Login & Personal Tracker System
Phase 1: Authentication Setup (Foundation)
What you need to do:

Set up Supabase authentication (email/password)
Create user authentication pages (login, signup, logout)
Add authentication context/hooks
Protect routes with authentication middleware
Files to create/modify:

lib/supabase.ts - Supabase client setup
app/login/page.tsx - Login page
app/signup/page.tsx - Signup page
hooks/useAuth.ts - Authentication hook
components/auth/ - Auth components
Phase 2: Database Schema & User Progress Tracking
What you need to do:

Create Supabase database tables for user progress
Set up user profiles and topic completion tracking
Create API functions for progress management
Add progress tracking to existing question pages
Database tables needed:

user_profiles - User information
topic_progress - Track completion per topic
question_attempts - Track individual question attempts
user_stats - Overall performance metrics
Phase 3: Progress Dashboard & Analytics
What you need to do:

Create user dashboard showing overall progress
Add topic-wise completion status
Implement performance analytics (accuracy, time spent)
Add progress visualization (charts, progress bars)
Files to create:

app/dashboard/page.tsx - Main dashboard
components/dashboard/ - Dashboard components
components/progress/ - Progress tracking components
FEATURE 2: Test Yourself System
Phase 4: Test Infrastructure Setup
What you need to do:

Create test configuration system (easy/medium/hard)
Set up timer functionality
Create test session management
Design test UI components
Files to create:

app/test/page.tsx - Test selection page
components/test/ - Test components
lib/testConfig.ts - Test configuration
hooks/useTimer.ts - Timer functionality
Phase 5: Question Delivery & Test Engine
What you need to do:

Create question selection algorithm by difficulty
Implement test session with timer
Add question navigation (next/previous)
Create answer submission system
Add test completion and results
Key components:

Test session state management
Question randomization
Answer validation
Score calculation
Phase 6: Test Results & Performance Analysis
What you need to do:

Create detailed test results page
Show performance breakdown by topic/difficulty
Add recommendations based on performance
Integrate with user progress tracking
Add test history and analytics
Implementation Order & Token Management:
Recommended Phase Sequence:
Phase 1 (Auth Setup) - ~100k tokens
Phase 2 (Database & Progress) - ~150k tokens
Phase 4 (Test Infrastructure) - ~100k tokens
Phase 5 (Test Engine) - ~150k tokens
Phase 3 (Dashboard) - ~100k tokens
Phase 6 (Test Results) - ~100k tokens
Why This Order:
Auth first - Foundation for everything else
Database setup - Required for both features
Test system - Core functionality before analytics
Dashboard last - Brings everything together
Token Management Strategy:
Each phase stays under 150k tokens
Focus on core functionality first
Add polish and advanced features later
Reuse existing components where possible
What to Start With:
I recommend starting with Phase 1 (Authentication Setup) as it's the foundation for both features. This will give you:

User login/signup system
Protected routes
User session management
Basic user profile setup
Would you like me to begin with Phase 1 and implement the authentication system first?
