# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving UI consistency and user experience across the HSC learning platform by standardizing reusable components, fixing homepage layout issues, simplifying navigation, and implementing interactive learning features. The current implementation has inconsistent page layouts across grammar/question/combined sections, a homepage animated card that changes size inappropriately, duplicate navigation links, and lacks interactive answer reveal functionality that would enhance the learning experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student navigating between grammar rules, questions, and combined section pages, I want consistent page layouts and component designs, so that the interface feels unified and predictable across all sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting grammar rules pages THEN the system SHALL use the same reusable component structure as question and combined pages
2. WHEN displaying HSC/SSC selection cards THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent size and styling across all three page types
3. WHEN showing topic cards THEN the system SHALL use identical dimensions and visual design regardless of section
4. WHEN rendering page layouts THEN the system SHALL ensure all three sections (grammar/questions/combined) look visually consistent
5. WHEN navigating between sections THEN the system SHALL provide a seamless, unified user experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student viewing the homepage, I want the animated card to maintain a constant size regardless of dynamic text changes, so that the layout remains stable and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dynamic text changes on the homepage THEN the animated card SHALL maintain fixed dimensions
2. WHEN displaying the right side animated card THEN the system SHALL use consistent width and height properties
3. WHEN text content updates THEN the card SHALL not resize or shift position
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the card SHALL maintain proportional but fixed sizing
5. WHEN animations play THEN the card SHALL remain stable without layout shifts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student using the homepage navigation, I want clear, non-repetitive links to different sections, so that I can easily access the content I need without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing homepage navigation THEN the system SHALL display only one "Get Started" link
2. WHEN showing learning section links THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate "Start Learning" and "Start Learning Now" buttons
3. WHEN displaying question page links THEN the system SHALL show only one link to the questions section
4. WHEN rendering navigation options THEN the system SHALL ensure each destination has exactly one clear path
5. WHEN users interact with navigation THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive, non-redundant options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student viewing modifier grammar pages, I want the introductory information card to be collapsible with tap-to-show functionality, so that I can access detailed information when needed while keeping the interface clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting modifier grammar pages THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible information card at the top
2. WHEN the card is collapsed THEN the system SHALL show an arrow icon indicating expandable content
3. WHEN tapping the card or arrow THEN the system SHALL expand to show full modifier information including "What is Modifier?" and types
4. WHEN tapping again THEN the system SHALL collapse the card to hide detailed information
5. WHEN displaying the card THEN the system SHALL include Bengali description and modifier types (Pre-modifier, Post-modifier)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student practicing with grammar examples, I want interactive answer reveal functionality with eye icons, so that I can test my knowledge before seeing the correct answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing grammar examples THEN the system SHALL display sentences with blank spaces and eye icons
2. WHEN answers are hidden by default THEN the system SHALL show eye icons in place of answers
3. WHEN tapping an eye icon THEN the system SHALL reveal the specific answer for that blank
4. WHEN tapping the revealed answer THEN the system SHALL hide it again and show the eye icon
5. WHEN displaying examples THEN the system SHALL format as "Cricket is an [eye icon] game. (Dhaka-2023)" initially
6. WHEN answer is revealed THEN the system SHALL show "Cricket is an [international] game. (Dhaka-2023)"

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student using grammar rule pages across different topics, I want the same interactive answer functionality available on all topic pages, so that I have a consistent learning experience throughout the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting any grammar topic rule page THEN the system SHALL provide the same eye icon answer reveal functionality
2. WHEN displaying examples on different topics THEN the system SHALL use the same reusable component for answer interaction
3. WHEN showing grammar rules THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent formatting with title, Bengali description, and interactive examples
4. WHEN implementing across topics THEN the system SHALL ensure the component works reliably on all grammar rule pages
5. WHEN students practice THEN the system SHALL provide uniform interaction patterns across all topics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student viewing grammar rule content, I want a clear information hierarchy with title first, Bengali description second, and interactive examples below, so that I can easily follow the learning progression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying grammar rules THEN the system SHALL show the rule title at the top
2. WHEN presenting content THEN the system SHALL display Bengali description on the second line
3. WHEN showing examples THEN the system SHALL place interactive examples below the description
4. WHEN rendering the layout THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing between title, description, and examples
5. WHEN displaying across different topics THEN the system SHALL use the same content hierarchy structure

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a student using the learning platform, I want the website to be lightweight and fast-loading, so that I can access content quickly without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading any page THEN the system SHALL optimize for fast loading times
2. WHEN displaying components THEN the system SHALL use efficient rendering techniques
3. WHEN implementing reusable components THEN the system SHALL reduce code duplication and bundle size
4. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth performance without lag
5. WHEN accessing content THEN the system SHALL provide responsive, lightweight user experience

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a student accessing the platform, I want unnecessary database dependencies and duplicate files removed, so that the application runs efficiently without bloat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing the codebase THEN the system SHALL remove all Supabase and database-related functions
2. WHEN cleaning up files THEN the system SHALL remove database-related folders and configurations
3. WHEN optimizing the project THEN the system SHALL eliminate duplicate or unnecessary files
4. WHEN maintaining the codebase THEN the system SHALL keep only essential files needed for the project
5. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL operate without database dependencies
