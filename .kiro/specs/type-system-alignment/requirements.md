# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses type compatibility issues between the existing grammar rule interfaces and the new generic interfaces used in the Combined Section feature. The current `ModifierRule` interface uses `GrammarLevel` which includes `"BOTH"` as a possible value, but the `GenericRule` interface only accepts `"HSC" | "SSC"`. This creates compilation errors when trying to use modifier rules in the combined section. The solution needs to maintain backward compatibility while enabling seamless integration between different parts of the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with the combined section feature, I want the type system to be compatible between existing grammar rule interfaces and new generic interfaces, so that I can use existing data without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `ModifierRule[]` with `GenericRule[]` THEN the system SHALL compile without type errors
2. WHEN `ModifierRule` has `level: GrammarLevel` THEN the system SHALL be compatible with `GenericRule` level requirements
3. WHEN `GrammarLevel` includes `"BOTH"` THEN the system SHALL handle this value appropriately in generic contexts
4. WHEN existing rule data is used THEN the system SHALL not require modifications to existing interfaces
5. WHEN type checking occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety while allowing compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer extending the combined section to other topics, I want a flexible type system that can accommodate different grammar level requirements, so that I can easily integrate various grammar topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating generic interfaces THEN the system SHALL support both specific and flexible level types
2. WHEN different topics have different level requirements THEN the system SHALL handle them uniformly
3. WHEN extending to new topics THEN the system SHALL not require changes to existing topic interfaces
4. WHEN processing rule data THEN the system SHALL handle optional and required properties appropriately
5. WHEN maintaining type safety THEN the system SHALL provide clear type definitions for all scenarios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want backward compatibility preserved for existing grammar rule interfaces, so that existing functionality continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing `ModifierRule` interface is used THEN the system SHALL continue to work as before
2. WHEN other grammar topics use similar interfaces THEN the system SHALL remain compatible
3. WHEN legacy code references rule properties THEN the system SHALL maintain the same property access patterns
4. WHEN updating type definitions THEN the system SHALL not break existing implementations
5. WHEN maintaining the system THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths if needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the combined section helper functions, I want the type system to properly infer and handle different rule and question types, so that I can use the helper functions without type casting or workarounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `createCombinedSectionConfig` THEN the system SHALL accept `ModifierRule[]` without type errors
2. WHEN processing rule arrays THEN the system SHALL handle different level value types appropriately
3. WHEN creating configurations THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety throughout the process
4. WHEN helper functions process data THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate type transformations
5. WHEN using generic helpers THEN the system SHALL work with specific topic implementations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the combined section layout, I want the component to accept various rule and question types seamlessly, so that I can focus on functionality rather than type compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `CombinedSectionLayout` receives rule data THEN the system SHALL handle different level types gracefully
2. WHEN processing rule properties THEN the system SHALL work with both optional and required properties
3. WHEN rendering rule information THEN the system SHALL display level information appropriately regardless of source type
4. WHEN filtering or sorting rules THEN the system SHALL handle different level value formats
5. WHEN component receives props THEN the system SHALL provide clear type definitions and error messages
