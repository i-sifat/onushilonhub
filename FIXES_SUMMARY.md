# Combined Section Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Modifier Questions Not Showing in Question Section
**Problem**: Questions weren't appearing when rules were selected due to two issues:
1. The system was looking for `question.ruleId` but the actual data structure has `ruleId` in the `blanks` array
2. The `filterByLevel()` function was filtering out modifier rules because they don't have individual `level` properties

**Solution**: 
- Updated `createRuleQuestionMapping()` in `lib/utils/combined-section-helpers.ts`
- Added logic to check both direct `ruleId` properties and `blanks` array
- Fixed `filterByLevel()` to include rules without level properties (backward compatibility)
- Now properly associates questions with rules based on their blank items

### 2. Rule Tapping Not Filtering Associated Questions
**Problem**: When users tapped on rules, the related questions weren't being filtered and displayed properly.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `CombinedSectionLayout` component to use proper rule-question mapping
- Added fallback logic to handle both mapping approaches
- Updated question counting to reflect actual associations

### 3. Missing Eye Icon for Answer Visibility
**Problem**: Questions were showing answers directly without user control.

**Solution**:
- Added eye icon button next to each question
- Implemented `visibleAnswers` state management with Set for performance
- Added smooth fade-in animations for answer reveal
- Eye icon changes between show/hide states with proper tooltips

## Technical Implementation Details

### Updated Files:
1. `lib/utils/combined-section-helpers.ts` - Enhanced mapping logic
2. `components/combined/CombinedSectionLayout.tsx` - Added eye icon functionality
3. `app/(learning)/combined-section/hsc/modifier/page.tsx` - Pass proper mappings
4. `__tests__/components/combined/CombinedSectionLayout.test.tsx` - Updated tests

### Key Features Added:
- **Smart Rule-Question Association**: Handles complex question structures with multiple rule associations
- **Interactive Answer Reveal**: Eye icon with smooth animations
- **Proper Question Counting**: Accurate counts reflecting actual associations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Data Structure Support:
The system now properly handles modifier questions with this structure:
```typescript
{
  id: "question-id",
  question: "Question text with (a) --- (hint) blanks",
  answer: "(a) answer",
  blanks: [
    { id: 'a', answer: 'answer', hints: ['hint'], ruleId: 1 }
  ]
}
```

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- Added new test for eye icon functionality
- Build process completes successfully
- Component renders correctly with proper question-rule associations

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Eye icon changes state to indicate answer visibility
2. **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects for better UX
3. **Proper Question Counts**: Accurate badges showing available questions per rule
4. **Consistent Design**: Matches existing design patterns in the app

The combined section now works as expected:
- ✅ Modifier questions show in the question section
- ✅ Rule tapping filters and displays associated questions
- ✅ Eye icon allows users to show/hide answers
- ✅ All functionality works on both desktop and mobile
