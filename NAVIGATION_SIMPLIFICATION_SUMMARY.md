- **Before**: "Start Learning Now" and "Explore Questions"
- **After**: "Get Started" and "Practice Questions"
- Updated CTA buttons to use consistent, clear navigation text
- Maintained same functionality and styling

#### 2. EnhancedNavbar Component
- **Before**: "Start Learning" in both desktop and mobile navigation
- **After**: "Get Started" in both desktop and mobile navigation
- Ensured consistency across all navigation elements

#### 3. About Page
- **Before**: "Start Learning Now" button
- **After**: "Get Started" button
- Maintained same functionality while using consistent text

#### 4. Test Updates

### Navigation Flow Verification

#### Primary Navigation Paths
1. **Get Started**: `/get-started` - Single, clear path to learning section
2. **Practice Questions**: `/board-questions` - Single, clear path to questions section

#### Consistency Achieved
- All components now use "Get Started" instead of variations like "Start Learning", "Start Learning Now"
